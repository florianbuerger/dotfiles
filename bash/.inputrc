# @section Key Bindings
#
#   macOS's Terminal.app allows you to edit your keycodes -- in 
#   other words, you can choose what happens when a set or series 
#   of complex keystokes is hit. In order for the codes to work 
#   with Readline, you need to set the action to "Send Text", and 
#   the text to the appropriate code.
#
#   In all of the following codes: `\e` == `\033`
