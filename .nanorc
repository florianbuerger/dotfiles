#   During startup, nano will first attempt to load the system-wide
#   settings from /etc/nanorc, then the user-specifc settings from
#   ~/.nanorc.

# @section Nano Options
#
#   Nano accepts a series of *set* or *unset* commands.
#
#   Options in a nanorc file take precedence override any default
#   settings. All options that do not take an argument are unset
#   by default. Therefore, using the unset command is only needed
#   when you are overriding a setting in /etc/nanorc inside of 
#   your ~/.nanorc file. Options that take an argument cannot be 
#   unset.
#
#   Quotes inside of string parameters do *not* have to be escaped.
#   The very last double quote in the string will be treated as the
#   ending delimiter of that string.

# @section Syntax Highlighting
#
#   Coloring different syntactic elements of a file is done by 
#   regular expressions.
#
#   The include "syntaxfile" directive allows nano to read in self-
#   contained color syntaxes from "syntaxfile". This is the 
#   preferred method.

# @section Key Bindings
#
#   Key bindings can be changed via the following two commands:
#
#       1. bind key function menu
#
#           Where `bind` rebinds `key` to `function` in the context 
#           of  `menu`, or in all menus by using `all`. 
#
#       2. unbind key menu
#       
#           Where `unbind` unbinds `key` from `menu` or from all
#           menus by using `all`.
#
#   The format of `key` should be:
#
#       1. `^` followed by an alpha character or the word "Space".
#       2. `M-` followed by a printable character or word "Space".
#       3. `F` followed by a numeric value from 1 to 16.
